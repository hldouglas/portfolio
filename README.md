I am an analytically inclined person who believes that everything doesn't appear as it seems. Design is always influenced by creativity and intrigue. My designs are clean, minimalistic, and straight to the point (with just a dash of mathematics).

My specialties include Motion Graphics and Web Development. Need a killer video or a sweet website coded? I'm also fantastic at illustration and branding if that's what you're looking for. Any projects that come my way and I'm the designer to do it AND have fun doing it! I'm passionate about what I do and excited to spread good design.

I'm quite comfortable with After Effects, Media Encoder, Illustrator, and InDesign. Photoshop, Lightroom, Adobe XD, and Dimensions I'm still getting acquainted with.
